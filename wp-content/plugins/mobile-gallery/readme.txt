Add a full-screen mobile friendly slideshow with touch controls to the built-in WordPress gallery system. 

== Description == 

Add a full-screen mobile friendly slideshow with touch controls to the built-in WordPress gallery system. Uses the awesome [PhotoSwipe](http://www.photoswipe.com/) library. 

For more advanced features be sure to check out our premium version of the plugin, [Mobile Gallery Pro](http://madebyraygun.com/wordpress/plugins/mobile-gallery-pro/).

== Installation ==

This plugin attaches a PhotoSwipe-powered mobile slideshow to the built-in WordPress <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode. To use this plugin, simply upload images to your post or page and click the "Insert Gallery" button. Make sure your gallery images link to the image files and not the attachment pages. The shorcode should look like <code>[gallery link=file]</code>. That's all there is to it! The plugin will take care of the rest.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: The gallery seems to be loaded properly but the images don't show up in the full-screen view.

A: Make sure your gallery shortcode includes the link=file attribute, e.g.: <code>[gallery link=file]</code>
